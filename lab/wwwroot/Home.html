<h2>Welcome to my HomePage!</h2>

<h4> Blogging</h4>
<div>
    I've never really blogged before. I don't really know what to put in this section because of that but here it is!
</div>

<h4>Developing</h4>
<div>
    I'm currently a junior develeoper. I'm learing a lot from some of the best teachers I can ask for. Hopefully one day I will be as good as them!

<h4>Hometown</h4>
<div>
    I was born in Bellvue hospital in Manhattan, NY. It was actually an insane aslyum and transitioned to regular hosital a few years before I was born. I lived with my parents in Astoria, Queens until I moved to Michigan when I was around 8. I've always wanted to move back to the big city and hopefully I can land developing job there once I finish Grand Circus!
